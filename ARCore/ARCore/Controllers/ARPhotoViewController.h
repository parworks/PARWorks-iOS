/** This test view controller is demo used for testing the integration of
 my sample photo augmentation project into the stuff Ben has been working on.
 
 Implementation starts from point that the device has received a response
 from the server and we have an image along with augmentation data. That data
 is then molded into the right format at passed to our augmentation view 
 which handles presentation.
